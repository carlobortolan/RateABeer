# TickTack

A Full-Stack Rust application empowered by WebAssembly (WASM).
> __NOTE__: __THIS PROJECT IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT.__

> __NOTE__: _At the moment_ [___https://ticktack-api.onrender.com___](https://ticktack-api.onrender.com/watches) _hosts the API and_ [___https://ticktack-frontend.onrender.com___](https://ticktack-frontend.onrender.com) _hosts the Frontend. You can find the docker-repository for the Frontend-image at_ `docker.io/carlobortolan/ticktack:frontend`.

> __DISCLAIMER__: _This is inspired by the [rust-fullstack-demo](https://github.com/toadslop/rust-fullstack-demo) as seen in [__"Tokyo Rust
Meetup - Fullstack Web Dev in Rust"__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5el5aFoJ8ws) and used to have a fun project for
> experimenting with Rust and WASM._

## FUNCTIONALITY

WASM based web-app that keeps track of the most polular mechanical wristwatches at the time, allowing users to rate and comment their favorite timepieces.
Or in the words of Ben Clymer:
> _"Welcome, watch enthusiasts, to TickTack, an extraordinary digital realm where the magic of horology unfolds in an
awe-inspiring tapestry of colors! Prepare to embark on a chromatic voyage, where the very essence of time is captured in
resplendent hues, giving life to exquisite wristwatches that beckon your admiration._
>
> _With every click, TickTack transports you into a realm where watch connoisseurs unite in a symphony of vibrant
conversations and captivating visual narratives. Delve into a luminous palette of watch photography, each frame a
testament to the artistry, craftsmanship, and boundless creativity of watchmakers from across the globe._
>
> _From the sun-kissed dials of azure blue, reminiscent of carefree coastal escapes, to the fiery depths of vibrant reds
that evoke a passionate ardor for horology, TickTack is an ever-evolving kaleidoscope of timekeeping marvels. Immerse
yourself in a spectrum of shades, from the elegant monochromes that embody timeless sophistication to the daring
chromatic symphonies that defy conventions._
>
> _As you traverse the opulent landscapes of TickTack, be prepared to engage in a realm of intellectual discourse and
enlightening dialogues. Connect with fellow horological explorers who share a fervor for the intricacies of watchmaking.
From insightful discussions on haute horlogerie complications to spirited debates on vintage versus modern aesthetics,
TickTack serves as the vibrant agora where horological enlightenment flourishes._
>
> _Capture your own horological adventures through the lens of your timepiece, sharing your chronometric masterpieces
with an audience that awaits your narrative. Experience the thrill of camaraderie as passionate watch collectors,
seasoned aficionados, and wide-eyed novices converge, embracing the boundless spectrums of time and color that unite us
all._
>
> _Join the luminous world of TickTack, where time is an exquisite work of art, and watches become the brushstrokes that
paint your wrist with unparalleled elegance. Let the vibrant spirit of TickTack ignite your imagination, as we celebrate
the hues, stories, and the infinite palette of possibilities that watches bring to our lives. The symphony of TickTack
awaits, where every tick and tock resonates with an extraordinary chromatic resonance."_

## RUNNING ON DOCKER

First install Docker.
You can find instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Next, install `docker-compose`.
This will allow us to build and run several docker containers simultaneously.
Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

In theory it would be sufficient to run `docker-compose up` and, once everything is up and running, visit http://localhost:8000 to view the app.

Note that docker-compose will start the app in production mode.

To push to your remote docker-repository run:
```
docker-compose up
docker tag ticktack-backend:latest <docker-username>/<docker-repository>:backend
docker tag ticktack-frontend:latest <docker-username>/<docker-repository>:frontend
docker push <docker-username>/<docker-repository>:backend
docker push <docker-username>/<docker-repository>:frontend
```


## RUNNING OUTSIDE DOCKER

### Database Installation

This app requires a Postgres 14 database.

Downloads for the various operating systems can be
found [here](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads)

#### Windows

Refer to this [article](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/install-postgresql/)

After installation, open your terminal and try running "psql".
If you find that the command isn't find, then you probably need to set some environment variables.
Follow the instructions in step 3 of
this [article](https://aeadedoyin.medium.com/getting-started-with-postgresql-on-windows-201906131300-ee75f066df78) to do
so.
Keep in mind that you will need to set the version to 14.

#### Mac

Refer to this [article](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/install-postgresql-macos/)

#### Linux

Refer to this [article](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/install-postgresql-linux/)

### Database Setup

Once you have a Postgres server up and running, create a database and make sure your database user has read and write
privileges.

Example:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
create database rustfullstack;
create user rustuser with encrypted password 'password';
grant all privileges on database rustfullstack to rustuser;
exit
```

NOTE: If you get an error message saying "connection refused", your postgres server may have installed on port 5433
rather than the default 5432. To resolve this, try using the -p flag as follows:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql -p 5433
```

### ENV file

You'll need a file to hold necessary environment variables.
If you're running docker, it should be named `docker.env` and contain the following:

```
FRONTEND_HOST=localhost
FRONTEND_PORT=8000
FRONTEND_PROTOCOL=http

DATABASE_PROTOCOL=postgres
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_URL=<SECRET>
POSTGRES_USER=<SECRET>
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<SECRET>
POSTGRES_DB=<SECRET>
POSTGRES_HOST=<SECRET>

BACKEND_HOST=localhost
BACKEND_HOST_INTERNAL=0.0.0.0
BACKEND_PORT=8080
BACKEND_PROTOCOL=http
```

If you're running it outside of docker, the file should be called `.env` and should contain the following:

```
FRONTEND_HOST=localhost
FRONTEND_PORT=8000
FRONTEND_PROTOCOL=http

DATABASE_PROTOCOL=postgres
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_URL=<SECRET>
POSTGRES_USER=<SECRET>
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<SECRET>
POSTGRES_DB=<SECRET>
POSTGRES_HOST=<SECRET>

BACKEND_HOST=localhost
BACKEND_PORT=8080
BACKEND_PROTOCOL=http
```

### Running the App

[Cargo Make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) as a task running to simplify starting and stopping the
application.
To use cargo make, run `cargo install cargo-make`.

To start the application in development mode, run `cargo make start_all`.

To start the application in production mode, run `cargo make start_all_prod`.

Note: On Windows, you might see the following error:

```powershell
<e> [webpack-dev-middleware] Error: spawn npm ENOENT
<e>     at ChildProcess._handle.onexit (node:internal/child_process:285:19)
<e>     at onErrorNT (node:internal/child_process:483:16)
<e>     at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:82:21) {
<e>   errno: -4058,
<e>   code: 'ENOENT',
<e>   syscall: 'spawn npm',
<e>   path: 'npm',
<e>   spawnargs: [ 'install', '-g', 'wasm-pack' ]
<e> }
```

If you get this error, run the following command and then try again:

```
npm install -g wasm-pack
```

To view all the available tasks, open Makefile.toml.
